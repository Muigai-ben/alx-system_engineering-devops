                                                  POSTMORTEM

A postmortem, in the context of software development and operations, is a retrospective analysis conducted after an incident or issue to understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future. In the context of the provided function, we can conduct a postmortem to analyze the code and identify potential improvements or issues.

Here's a simple postmortem for the provided function:

Postmortem Analysis:
User-Agent Handling:

Issue: The User-Agent in the headers is set to a placeholder ('YourCustomUserAgent/1.0'). A meaningful User-Agent should be provided.
Recommendation: Replace the placeholder with a real User-Agent string that accurately represents your application.
Error Handling:

Issue: The function catches requests.RequestException but doesn't provide detailed error information.
Recommendation: Improve error handling by logging or printing detailed error messages. This helps in diagnosing issues during development or when deployed.
API Response Handling:

Issue: The function assumes a successful response contains the expected JSON structure.
Recommendation: Add checks to ensure that the expected keys ('data' and 'subscribers') are present in the JSON response before accessing them to prevent potential errors.
Code Organization:

Issue: The function has a mix of logic, error handling, and example usage in the same block of code.
Recommendation: Consider organizing the code into separate functions for better modularity and readability. Separate the example usage from the function definition.
Documentation:

Issue: The function lacks inline comments or docstrings explaining its purpose and usage.
Recommendation: Add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose of the function, expected parameters, and the structure of the returned data.i
